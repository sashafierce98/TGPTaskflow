  "summary": "The agent's fix correctly addresses both user-reported issues. The drag-and-drop 'hanging' issue is resolved by removing the post-drop refetch and using optimistic updates.

      "location": "/app/frontend/src/components/ui/button.jsx:17,20",
      "issue": "Button component still uses 'hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground' for outline and ghost variants. The accent color (245 158 11) is orange/yellow, which could cause yellow hover states on buttons throughout the app.",
      "impact": "Ghost buttons (back button, settings buttons, edit/delete card buttons) will show orange/yellow background on hover. This is a secondary issue but could still cause user confusion about 'yellow' elements.",
